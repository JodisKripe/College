The term "kamikaze" is historically significant in Japanese history, particularly during the late 13th century. 
The first occurrence of the word "kamikaze" in Japanese history refers to the divine wind that thwarted the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274 and again in 1281.

The first incident took place in autumn 1274 when a Mongol fleet of 500 to 900 ships carrying 30,000 to 40,000 men attacked Japan. 
While in Hakata Bay, Kyushu, a typhoon hit the fleet. An estimated 13,000 men drowned, around one-third of the ships sank, and the rest were damaged.

During the time period between the first and second invasion, the Japanese prudently built two-meter-high walls to protect themselves from future assaults.

Seven years later, the Mongols returned. Unable to find any suitable landing beaches due to the walls, the fleet stayed afloat for months and depleted their supplies as they searched for an area to land. 
After months of being exposed to the elements, the fleet was destroyed by a great typhoon, which the Japanese called "kamikaze" (divine wind). 
The Mongols never attacked Japan again, and more than 70,000 men were said to have been captured.

In the summer of 1281, Kublai Khan, the Mongol Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, launched a massive invasion fleet to conquer Japan. 
The Mongol forces, consisting of thousands of ships and troops, aimed to subjugate the Japanese islands under Kublai Khan's rule. 
However, as the Mongol armada approached the Japanese coast, a typhoon, later dubbed as the "kamikaze" or "divine wind," struck the fleet.
The second fleet was larger, comprising two forces with an estimated total of 4,400 ships and 140,000 men, greatly outnumbering the Japanese soldiers, who had an estimated 40,000 samurai and other fighting men. 
The typhoon led to the death of at least half the men, and only a few hundred vessels survived. 
Following the storm, most survivors were killed by the Japanese. This event is considered "one of the largest and most disastrous attempts at a naval invasion in history."

The fierce winds and rough seas destroyed a significant portion of the Mongol fleet, sinking numerous ships and drowning soldiers. 
The typhoon not only caused substantial damage to the Mongol invasion force but also disrupted their logistical capabilities and morale. 
The surviving Mongol forces faced fierce resistance from the Japanese defenders upon their attempted landings.

The divine wind, believed by the Japanese to be a manifestation of divine intervention in their favor, was credited with saving Japan from foreign invasion.
The term "kamikaze" came to symbolize the protective power of nature and the divine protection of Japan.

The Second Occurence of the word "KamiKaze" was during the World War 2 

KamiKaze were a part of the Japanese Special Attack Units of military aviators who flew suicide attacks for the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II, intending to destroy warships more effectively than with conventional air attacks. 
About 3,800 kamikaze pilots died during the war, and more than 7,000 naval personnel were killed by kamikaze attacks.
In Japanese, the formal term used for units carrying out suicide attacks during 1944–1945 is tokubetsu kōgekitai, which literally means "special attack unit". 
This is usually abbreviated to tokkōtai. More specifically, air suicide attack units from the Imperial Japanese Navy were officially called shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai ("divine wind special attack units").

One example of this may have occurred on 7 December 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
First Lieutenant Fusata Iida's aircraft had taken a hit and had started leaking fuel when he apparently used it to make a suicide attack on Naval Air Station Kaneohe. 
Before taking off, he had told his men that if his aircraft were to become badly damaged he would crash it into a "worthy enemy target".

As the war progressed and Japan faced increasing military setbacks, particularly after the Battle of Midway in 1942, Japanese military leaders sought unconventional tactics to counter Allied advancements. 
In 1944, the idea of using suicide attacks by aircraft emerged, with the goal of inflicting maximum damage on Allied ships while sacrificing the pilots.

Kamikaze pilots, often young volunteers or individuals motivated by patriotism and indoctrination, would deliberately crash their aircraft into enemy ships, typically loaded with explosives. 
These attacks were intended to create psychological shock, disrupt naval operations, and stem the tide of Allied advances.

The kamikaze tactics were employed in various naval battles throughout the latter stages of the war, including the battles of Leyte Gulf, Okinawa, and others. 
These suicide attacks inflicted significant casualties and damage on Allied vessels, contributing to a sense of fear and uncertainty among Allied forces.

Despite their impact, kamikaze attacks were not sufficient to alter the course of the war, and Japan ultimately surrendered in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
However, the kamikaze phenomenon left a lasting mark on military history, representing the extreme measures taken by a desperate nation and the willingness of individuals to sacrifice themselves for their country's cause.

In modern history, the term "kamikaze" continues to evoke notions of self-sacrifice and extreme devotion, albeit with broader connotations beyond its original military context.
